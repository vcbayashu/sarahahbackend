1. Make sure you have an account on a deployment platform (e.g. Heroku,Render,AWS, DO etc). We will be using Render for our use case.
2. Make you have a working MongodB Atlas cluster which connects successfuly to your server.
3. Make sure your both repositories (frontend/backend) are pushed on GITHUB.
4. Make sure your PORT number is dynamic i.e. (const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;)
5. Make sure your MongodB URL is not hard coded but placed inside ENV file.
6. Make sure you have a .gitignore file which have mentioned node_modules and .env file.
7. Please note that only backend repository is used for deployment purposes on the deployment platform (render, heroku, DO etc) in such a way
   that a build file from frontend is placed inside backend client/ folder
